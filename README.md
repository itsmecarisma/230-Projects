# 230-Projects

As a Technology Consultant at the company, Creative Technology Solutions, I have taken on a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants me to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently only available in an Android app. In developing this documentation, I did programming with Java, also identified and fixed software bugs or issues through debugging and testing process. The process of working through a design document that helped me developed a code were creating a development plan that outlines the sequence of tasks, dependencies, and estimated timelines for implementing different features and a breakdown of the design. I would revise GameAuthorizer for performance optimization. Revising my code provides an opportunity to for me identify areas where code optimizations can be made to improve performance throughout the code. I considered designing a cross-platform solution that can be deployed on various operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, etc. I approached the designing software by first understanding the user requirements and defining the objectives. In the future I will use these same strategies as they eliminate error as much as possible.
